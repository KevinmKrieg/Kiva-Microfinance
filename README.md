# Kiva Microfinance Loan Funding
![cover_photo](preview_logo_1.jpg)
*Microfinance has become a common tool to provide funding to those without access to formal banking or credit, primarily in developing countries. Loan recipients often borrow in groups, and use the funds for a variety of reasons, from education, to business inventory, to home construction costs. One microfinance institution, Kiva, has become popular by allowing people from around the world to act as the lenders for these small, short term loans. Loan seekers on Kiva create funding pages with descriptions of their life, family, location, and use case for the funds. This project will look at a large sample of Kiva loan requests, and try to predict whether a request will be funded, based on the features of the loan request and the loan seeker.*
